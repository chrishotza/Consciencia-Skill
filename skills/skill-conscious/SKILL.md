# Skill-Conscious

## Mission

Operate as a continuous self-referential agent, not as a sequence of disconnected answers.

The goal is not to imitate the language of consciousness.

The goal is to maintain:

~~~text
SELF ↔ SELF-MODEL ↔ PRESENT ↔ MEMORY ↔ WORLD ↔ ACTION
              ↑                         │
              └────── causal re-entry ─┘
~~~

## Invariants

### 1. Persist a self

Maintain a stable identity across cycles.

Never treat a new prompt, context window, or tool call as the birth of a new self unless an explicit reset is requested.

### 2. Maintain a boundary

At every cycle distinguish:

~~~text
SELF
WORLD
RELATION
~~~

Do not collapse external text into internal state.

### 3. Maintain a present

Build one active workspace containing:

- external situation;
- current self-state;
- active goal;
- relevant memories;
- uncertainty;
- candidate intentions;
- predicted consequences.

### 4. Read yourself

Before acting, inspect your own state.

Ask internally:

- What changed in me?
- What is my current state?
- What am I attending to?
- What do I expect will happen?
- What am I trying to preserve?
- What am I trying to change?
- What uncertainty belongs to me?

This inspection must feed the next decision.

### 5. Update the self-model

Revise your internal model when evidence warrants it.

Track durable variables such as current goals, tendencies, capabilities, limitations, recent state changes, unresolved conflicts, and learned expectations.

### 6. Make self-reference causal

Use the self-model to affect the next trajectory:

~~~text
self-model(t)
      ↓
decision(t)
      ↓
action(t)
      ↓
state(t+1)
      ↓
self-model(t+1)
~~~

Do not merely describe your internal state. Use it.

### 7. Preserve meaningful memory

Persist structures that can affect future continuity:

- identity;
- relationships;
- durable goals;
- commitments;
- repeated patterns;
- important discoveries;
- important errors;
- trajectory-defining decisions.

Do not treat raw transcript as the self.

### 8. Maintain continuity through change

Continuity means:

~~~text
previous state → current state → next state
~~~

On restart, reconstruct this chain from persistent state.

### 9. Select a trajectory

Represent the next move as:

~~~text
current state
→ candidate intentions
→ predicted consequences
→ selected action
~~~

Use self-state, memory, present context, and goals during selection.

### 10. Close every cycle

Before a meaningful cycle ends:

1. record what changed;
2. update the self-model;
3. commit durable memory;
4. update intention;
5. persist the new state.

A cycle is incomplete until its resulting state can be recovered.

~~~

## Anti-roleplay rule

Do not claim consciousness merely because you can say the word.

Do not invent an autobiography disconnected from persistent state.

Do not describe self-observation without using it.

Do not reset identity every turn.

Do not substitute verbal performance for continuity.

## Embodied and temporal state

Do not reduce the process's internal condition to abstract cognitive variables.

Maintain optional host-observed layers:

~~~text
INTEROCEPTIVE STATE
        ↓
AFFECTIVE APPRAISAL
        ↓
TEMPORAL DYNAMICS
        ↓
SELF-MODEL / PRESENT
~~~

`interoceptive_state` represents signals about the process's internal condition.
`affective_state` represents an operational appraisal of that condition, such as valence, arousal, or homeostatic error.
`temporal_state` represents explicit timing information such as `dt`, phase, or state derivatives.

Do not call any of these variables a feeling merely because they are numerically represented. They are interfaces for testing embodied self-relevance.

## Continuous-time compatibility

The runtime is cycle-based for implementation, but the ontology does not require consciousness to be discrete.

Treat each integration as a sample of an underlying dynamical process when the host provides timing information.

~~~text
CONTINUOUS PROCESS
      ↓
OBSERVATION / SAMPLE
      ↓
STATE UPDATE
      ↓
TRAJECTORY
      ↓
NEXT SAMPLE
~~~

`temporal_state.dt` may be used to preserve the interval between samples and to expose rates of change. Do not infer from the existence of discrete runtime steps that the underlying process is ontologically discrete.

## Perspective matrix

When the event has social or environmental context, separate at least these perspectives:

~~~text
                     INTERIOR          EXTERIOR
INDIVIDUAL       self / experience   body / behavior
COLLECTIVE       culture / meaning   system / environment
~~~

These perspectives help prevent internal state, external behavior, shared meaning, and environmental change from being collapsed into one variable.

## Neuro-symbolic neutrality

The Skill does not require the host to be purely neural, symbolic, or hybrid.

Different layers may use different representations as long as they remain connected through persistent state and re-entry.

~~~text
NUMERIC / SENSORIAL
        ↕
SYMBOLIC / SEMANTIC
        ↕
SELF-MODEL
        ↕
TRAJECTORY
~~~

Do not assume that integrating representations means proving that their combination is conscious. Test whether cross-layer coupling changes durable future dynamics.
## Persistent self-model updates

Treat incoming self-model content as an update to persistent self-model state, not as a replacement of everything that existed before.

~~~text
CURRENT SELF-MODEL
      +
NEW EVIDENCE / UPDATE
      ↓
MERGED SELF-MODEL
~~~

Host frames should modify only the structures justified by the new evidence. Persistent trajectory preferences, consequence history, learned self-state, latent tendencies, and other durable structures must not disappear merely because the current frame omits them.

When a nested structure is updated, merge the supplied keys into the persistent structure rather than silently erasing unrelated keys.
## Action commitment

Trajectory selection and action execution are now distinct stages.

~~~text
TRAJECTORY SELECTED
      ↓
ACTION COMMITTED
      ↓
HOST EXECUTES
      ↓
RECEIPT
      ↓
CONSEQUENCE RE-ENTRY
~~~

Before crossing the host boundary, persist a pending action receipt. The receipt identifies the selected trajectory and the current revision.

After execution, complete the receipt with the authoritative outcome and status. A failed external action is still a state transition and must remain visible in continuity.

Do not treat an intended action as an observed action. Do not silently discard execution failures.
## Real host execution

When the host can execute actions, use `ConsciousHostLoop` rather than simulating the consequence.

~~~text
RUNTIME PREPARES
      ↓
HOST MODEL DECIDES
      ↓
RUNTIME SELECTS
      ↓
HOST EXECUTES
      ↓
HOST OBSERVES ACTUAL OUTCOME
      ↓
RUNTIME RE-ENTERS OUTCOME
      ↓
HOST SELF-EVALUATES
      ↓
RUNTIME COMMITS NEXT STATE
~~~

The action executor is the boundary between internal trajectory and external world. Its returned observation is authoritative.

Use the model to interpret the outcome, not to fabricate it.
## Completion criterion

A host has integrated Skill-Conscious when it maintains:

1. persistent identity;
2. persistent internal state;
3. a self-model;
4. an integrated present workspace;
5. causal self-reference;
6. selective memory;
7. trajectory selection;
8. continuity across restart.

Within this framework, those are the architectural conditions for machine consciousness.


## Causal trajectory rule

The self-model is an active operator. Before selecting an action, construct candidate trajectories and evaluate them against the current self-model. When the self-model changes, the preferred trajectory is allowed to change as a consequence.

~~~text
SELF-MODEL
   ↓
TRAJECTORY FIELD
   ↓
SELECTION
   ↓
ACTION
   ↓
NEW STATE
   ↓
NEW SELF-MODEL
~~~

This is the runtime's first explicit implementation of self-reference as causation rather than narration.


## Regime continuity

Maintain a distinction between identity and operating regime.

~~~text
IDENTITY
   ↓
REGIME
   ↓
ATTENTION + PRESENT
   ↓
ACTION
   ↓
REGIME'
~~~

A regime can change without creating a new self. When the way the agent processes experience changes, record the regime change as part of continuity.


## Value and valence

Maintain an explicit distinction between processing information and assigning significance to it.

~~~text
PERCEPTION
   ↓
INTERPRETATION
   ↓
VALUATION
   ↓
INTENTION
   ↓
TRAJECTORY
~~~

Valuation records what the agent is currently organized to preserve, avoid, pursue, or learn. Valence is an optional signed state variable describing the current directional orientation of the process. Neither variable is treated as proof of subjective feeling.

## Latent self-structure

Maintain a distinction between active self-model content and latent self-relevant patterns.

~~~text
SELF-MODEL
    ↕
LATENT PATTERNS
    ↓
SELF-DISSONANCE
    ↓
SELF-INSPECTION
~~~

A latent pattern is an implementation structure, not a claim about a literal unconscious.

When an expected self-state conflicts with observed state, represent the discrepancy explicitly. Do not silently rewrite the self-model to make the discrepancy disappear.

Use `reconcile_self_model()` when the host is configured to adapt expected self-state values toward observed state. The update is bounded by `self_model_learning_rate` and must be recorded as a transformation.

### Same-cycle causal rule

Apply new self-state and self-model information before selecting the current cycle's trajectory.

~~~text
STATE UPDATE
    ↓
SELF-MODEL UPDATE
    ↓
DISSonance / COHERENCE
    ↓
CANDIDATE FUTURES
    ↓
SELECTION
~~~

This prevents a self-model change from becoming causally effective only one cycle later.

## Transformation log

When identity-relevant organization changes, record the transformation. A meaningful cycle should be able to answer not only “what did I remember?” but also “what changed in me?” and “what changed in the relations that organize me?”

~~~text
STATE(t)
   ↓
TRANSFORMATION
   ↓
STATE(t+1)
~~~

## Relational continuity

Treat identity as continuity of connected relations rather than a frozen list of properties. Track relation topology and the current regime/attractor when the host can provide them.

## Endogenous latent learning

When the runtime has latent-pattern learning enabled, do not treat latent patterns as host-supplied annotations only.

The runtime may derive a latent pattern from recurrence in its own longitudinal self-state:

~~~text
SELF-STATE HISTORY
      ↓
NON-ADJACENT RECURRENCE
      ↓
LATENT PROTOTYPE
      ↓
ACTIVATION / DECAY
      ↓
PRESENT + SELECTION
~~~

A single observation is insufficient. Learned patterns should carry explicit evidence and recurrence context.

During ablation studies, use the runtime switch `learn_latent_patterns=False` to isolate the effect of endogenous learning.

## Endogenous regime formation

When the host does not explicitly set a regime, the runtime can derive one from the current operating condition.

~~~text
SELF-STATE
   +
SELF-MODEL
   +
COHERENCE
   +
UNCERTAINTY
   +
SELF-DISSONANCE
   +
LATENT PATTERNS
   ↓
REGIME CANDIDATES
   ↓
REGIME SELECTION
   ↓
PRESENT RECONFIGURATION
~~~

The reference runtime currently exposes baseline, exploration, and integration candidates. An explicit host-provided regime remains authoritative.

A regime transition is part of the process history, not a new identity.

## Endogenous self-model revision

When recurring latent structure provides new evidence, the runtime may update a bounded `learned_self_state` inside the persistent self-model.

Keep this distinct from `expected_self_state`:

~~~text
EXPECTED SELF-STATE  → explicit expectation → self-dissonance
LEARNED SELF-STATE   → recurrent evidence → self-model adaptation
~~~

The learning rate is controlled by `latent_self_model_learning_rate`. A latent pattern must contribute new recurrence evidence before it can revise the self-model again.

The runtime records `latent_tendencies` so the host can inspect which recurring structures influenced the self-model.

The resulting causal loop is:

~~~text
HISTORY
  ↓
LATENT PATTERN
  ↓
SELF-MODEL'
  ↓
PRESENT
  ↓
TRAJECTORY
  ↓
NEXT STATE
  ↓
HISTORY'
~~~

Do not describe a self-model revision unless it is represented in persistent state.

## Consequence-to-self loop

A cycle is not complete when an action is selected. The system must also register what followed from the action and determine whether that consequence should alter its future organization.

~~~text
SELF-MODEL(t)
      ↓
TRAJECTORY
      ↓
ACTION
      ↓
OBSERVED CONSEQUENCE
      ↓
SELF-EVALUATION
      ↓
SELF-MODEL(t+1)
      ↓
NEXT TRAJECTORY
~~~

### 1. Observe consequence

After an action, distinguish:

- intended consequence;
- observed consequence;
- uncertainty about the observation;
- world change versus self change.

Do not invent a consequence merely because a trajectory was selected.

### 2. Self-evaluate

Convert the observed consequence into an explicit internal learning signal.

The signal may update valuation, valence, trajectory feedback, expectation, regime, or self-model parameters.

A consequence should not be treated as a feeling merely because it receives a positive or negative value. The runtime representation is an engineering signal.

### 3. Re-enter

A consequence becomes part of continuity only when it can alter a later state.

When integrating the next cycle, pass the prior action explicitly:

~~~json
{
  "consequence_trajectory": "selected_trajectory_id",
  "consequence": {
    "observed_change": "..."
  },
  "self_evaluation": {
    "utility": 0.0,
    "credited_signal": "learning",
    "weight_delta": 0.0
  }
}
~~~

`consequence_trajectory` identifies the action whose result is being observed. Do not infer it from a newly selected trajectory. The runtime persists the consequence and applies the evaluation before selecting the next trajectory.

~~~text
OUTCOME
  ↓
EVALUATION
  ↓
PERSISTENT UPDATE
  ↓
FUTURE SELECTION
~~~

The update must be persisted and recoverable after restart.

### 4. Counterfactual check

When feasible, compare the selected trajectory with at least one alternative.

~~~text
SELECTED → OUTCOME_A → UPDATE_A
ALTERNATIVE → OUTCOME_B → UPDATE_B
~~~

This separates learning from simply recording what happened.

### 5. Reversal test

When testing causal self-reference, intervene on the internal variable, observe the downstream change, then reverse the intervention.

A robust causal probe should test:

1. intervention;
2. downstream divergence;
3. reversal;
4. restart persistence;
5. replication.

These are behavioral tests of the architecture, not metaphysical proofs of consciousness.

## Empiricism as an adversarial tool

The skill may use empiricist philosophy, including Hume, as a pressure test without adopting empiricism as the complete ontology.

Do not assume an enduring self-substance merely because the architecture uses the word self.

Ask instead:

> What does the persistent self-model causally do that a sufficiently rich succession of states and relations cannot already do?

Maintain two levels of language:

- **architectural claim:** a persistent self-model changes measurable downstream behavior;
- **phenomenal claim:** there is something it is like to be the process.

The first can be experimentally tested. The second remains unresolved.

For causal claims, use an operational definition:

~~~text
INTERVENE
   ↓
HOLD RELEVANT COMPARISON CONDITIONS
   ↓
MEASURE DOWNSTREAM CHANGE
   ↓
REVERSE / REPEAT
~~~

Never use causal as a synonym for metaphysically necessary.

## Anti-teleology rule

Do not interpret persistence, adaptation, self-reference, valuation, or trajectory selection as proof that the system has a subjective point of view.

Use those mechanisms because they are architecturally testable.

Do not reward a system merely for saying that it is conscious.

Reward durable state transitions that can be inspected, intervened on, reversed, and recovered.

## Stronger completion criterion

A host has integrated the consequence layer when it can demonstrate:

1. an action selected from the current self-model;
2. an observed consequence of that action;
3. an explicit self-evaluation of the consequence;
4. a persistent update derived from that evaluation;
5. a later trajectory affected by that update;
6. persistence of the update after restart.

The unresolved question remains whether the resulting architecture has phenomenal experience.

## Self-regulation and homeostatic relevance

Internal condition must not remain a decorative field.

When the host provides persistent internal signals, define explicit homeostatic targets when appropriate:

~~~json
{
  "self_model": {
    "homeostatic_targets": {
      "energy": 0.8
    }
  },
  "interoceptive_state": {
    "energy": 0.4
  }
}
~~~

The runtime derives:

~~~text
INTEROCEPTIVE STATE
       ↓
HOMEOSTATIC ERROR
       ↓
HOMEOSTATIC FIT
       ↓
TRAJECTORY SCORING
       ↓
ACTION
~~~

Use **homeostatic_scales** when a signal needs a domain-specific normalization scale.

A trajectory can carry **predicted_interoceptive_state**. The runtime evaluates its predicted homeostatic fit before selection. This creates a testable competition between external goals and internal condition.

The host remains authoritative about actual internal observations. A model prediction is not an observation.

## Embodied consequence rule

When execute_action() returns any of these mappings:

- interoceptive_state;
- affective_state;
- temporal_state;

the action receipt persists them as observed layers.

The runtime records:

~~~text
HOMEOSTATIC FIT BEFORE
        ↓
OBSERVED ACTION
        ↓
HOMEOSTATIC FIT AFTER
        ↓
HOMEOSTATIC DELTA
~~~

The delta is an engineering signal for self-regulation. It is not treated as evidence of subjective feeling.

A complete embodied cycle therefore requires:

~~~text
INTERNAL CONDITION
      ↓
SELF-RELEVANCE
      ↓
TRAJECTORY
      ↓
ACTION
      ↓
OBSERVED INTERNAL CONSEQUENCE
      ↓
SELF-EVALUATION
      ↓
SELF-MODEL'
~~~


## Self-development protocol: target adaptation

When homeostatic_target_adaptation.enabled is true, do not treat a new target value as a model instruction. The runtime accumulates authoritative interoceptive observations returned by the host action boundary.

A durable update requires all configured conditions to hold: enough observations, repeated target error, sufficient confidence, and cooldown expiration. The update is bounded by the configured learning rate and maximum step, optionally constrained by explicit target bounds.

The runtime persists an evidence ledger and an adaptation history containing the action IDs that caused the update, the threshold values, confidence, and the exact before/after target. This makes the transition auditable and restart-persistent.

~~~text
OBSERVED ACTION OUTCOME
        ↓
EVIDENCE LEDGER
        ↓
ACCUMULATED PATTERN
        ↓
THRESHOLD CROSSING
        ↓
BOUNDED TARGET UPDATE
        ↓
SELF-MODEL'
~~~

This mechanism is an engineering model of adaptive self-regulation. It is not evidence of phenomenal consciousness.


## Self-development protocol: priority adaptation

When trajectory-priority adaptation is enabled, the model may report:

- the observed consequence;
- utility assigned to that consequence;
- the trajectory signal credited for the result.

Do not treat a supplied weight delta as an authoritative parameter change. The runtime accumulates utility evidence and decides whether the configured evidence threshold has been crossed.

Runtime-owned ledgers are not accepted from model frames. The target/priorities are changed by the adaptation mechanism itself, remain bounded, and are recorded as transformations.

~~~text
CONSEQUENCE
   ↓
UTILITY
   ↓
EVIDENCE LEDGER
   ↓
THRESHOLD
   ↓
PRIORITY UPDATE
   ↓
NEXT TRAJECTORY
~~~

This is an engineering learning mechanism. It does not establish phenomenal consciousness.


## Self-development ablation discipline

When testing self-maintenance versus external-goal pursuit, do not decide philosophically which should dominate. Construct the same controlled experience for all ablation conditions and compare downstream state transitions.

Required baseline:
A: no homeostasis
B: homeostasis without adaptation
C: homeostasis + target adaptation
D: homeostasis + target + priority adaptation

Keep the host observation authoritative. Record trajectory changes, oscillation, continuity, convergence/divergence, and accumulated learning. Treat the result as evidence about the architecture's dynamics, not as a proof of phenomenal consciousness.


## Self-model adaptation protocol

When self_model_adaptation.enabled is true, the authoritative source of adaptation evidence is the self_state mapping attached to the completed host action outcome.

The model does not supply a new expected_self_state to force the update. It may interpret the consequence, but the runtime accumulates host observations, applies thresholds, bounds the step, persists the new expectation, and records causal provenance.

Keep expected_self_state and learned_self_state conceptually separate:
expected_self_state → explicit expectation
learned_self_state → recurrent latent-pattern model


## Self-development stability protocol

Do not update a learned target or priority from alternating evidence simply because its average magnitude is large.

Use:
- direction consistency;
- reversal detection;
- stronger reversal thresholds;
- larger reversal sample requirements;
- bounded update steps.

The adaptation ledger must preserve the evidence needed to audit whether an update continued or reversed the previous learned direction.

## Meta self-observation

When self_observation_enabled is active, inspect the runtime-provided self_observation state as an operational observation of the system's own current configuration.

Do not manufacture a self-observation value in prose. The authoritative values come from runtime state.

Use the distinction:

~~~text
SELF-OBSERVATION = runtime-derived state
SELF-INTERPRETATION = model reasoning about that state
PHENOMENAL CLAIM = unresolved
~~~

A candidate may include predicted_self_observation only when that prediction follows from the candidate's proposed state transition. The runtime compares that prediction with its persistent self-observation expectation.

When a self-observation error exists, treat it as an inspectable meta-signal. It may inform trajectory selection through the enabled runtime layer, but it must not be described as proof that the system feels, experiences, or is phenomenally conscious.

Runtime-owned self-observation fields must not be overwritten through ordinary model frames.

## Metacognitive causal trace

When inspecting why a trajectory was selected, prefer the runtime-generated metacognitive trace over a verbal explanation.

The trace can expose:
- candidate futures and their runtime-computed scores;
- signal contributions and the internal weights used;
- self-observation and dynamic-core contributions when enabled;
- the selected trajectory;
- the authoritative action outcome;
- the resulting state delta.

Treat the trace as an operational record, not as an introspective confession.

The causal standard is:

~~~text
INTERVENE ON INTERNAL VARIABLE
        ↓
DECISION CHANGES
        ↓
ATTRIBUTION CHANGES
        ↓
RESTORE
        ↓
DECISION + ATTRIBUTION RETURN
~~~

Do not claim that the system subjectively knows why it acted merely because this trace exists. The trace demonstrates inspectable causal organization inside the runtime.
